rdware Debug Log: Motor Driver & Power Supply Issues

## Issue 1: SY8205 Voltage Drop
- **Description**:  
  Four 1.3V batteries in series output 5.25V, but the voltage drops to 4.7V after passing through the SY8205 buck converter.
- **Hypothesis**:  
  Potential manufacturing defect in the SY8205 module.
- **Action**:  
  Proceeded with testing despite risks to the PCB (voltage instability might damage components).

## Issue 2: Jetson Nano GPIO & L7110S Motor Driver
- **Setup**:  
  - Jetson Nano GPIO pin 27 outputs 3V to L7110S motor driver (B1/B2 connected to GND).
  - **Expected**: MOTORB should drive wheels.
  - **Observed**: MOTORB outputs no power.

### Voltage Measurements
| Nodes       | Voltage (V) | Notes                        |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| A - B       | 2.9         | Within tolerance             |
| OA - OB     | 0           | Critical issue               |
| VCC - OA    | 5           | Power supply functional      |
| OA - GND    | 6           | Too high (DS: <0.25V)        |
| OB - GND    | 3           | Exceeds spec (DS: <0.25V)    |

## Debug Steps
1. **Power Supply Adjustment**:
   - Switched Jetson Nano’s power supply to match the PCB’s source (SY8205).
   - **Result**: Motor spun briefly (~1s), then Nano shut down. Repeated attempts yielded identical behavior.

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - SY8205 inefficiency likely triggered U-Boot’s protection mechanism due to unstable voltage.
   - **Solution**: Connected both power bank and battery GNDs. System stabilized, motor functioned normally.
